# Starling Bank Technical Challenge

We‚Äôd like you to develop a ‚Äúround-up‚Äù feature for Starling customers using our public developer API that is available to all customers and partners.

For a customer, take all the transactions in a given week and round them up to the nearest pound.
For example with spending of ¬£4.35, ¬£5.20 and ¬£0.87, the round-up would be ¬£1.58.
This amount should then be transferred into a savings goal, helping the customer save for future adventures.

## Usage

### Usage - Logging
The log level defaults to `info`, but you can set level via the command line argument `--log-level` or the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` can be used to set the logging level. If both are set the command line value takes precedence.

## Development
[üåç Earthly](https://earthly.dev) is used as the build tool, it is a CI/CD framework that allows you to develop pipelines locally and run them anywhere.
Earthly leverages containers for the execution of pipelines.
This makes them self-contained, repeatable, portable and parallel.

### Setup
You only need Earthly and Docker installed, Earthly handles all build and runtime dependencies.

* [Get Earthly](https://earthly.dev/get-earthly)
